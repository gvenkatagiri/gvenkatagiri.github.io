__ANIRUDH__ Kanisetti's _Lords of the Deccan_ reads like a summer blockbuster - lots of drama and intrigue, full of heroes and villains and takes you on a journey worth the price of admission. Skilfully packaged within that perfectly enjoyable exterior though, is a deeply thoughtful and nuanced take on medieval South Indian history that will make you question the way we are expected to comprehend history in general. The heroes and villains in this tale consistently switch positions and all the drama and intrigue, like in real life, is fueled by human desires like power, legacy & self-preservation. Kanisetti joins a burgeoning club of contemporary historians who are confident enough to adopt the fairly novel approach of looking at our subcontinent's history, in all it's monumental greyness, in a self-respecting but honest and unbiased manner.

__ENRICHED__ by Kanisetti's surefooted & imaginative narrative flourishes, the history presented in the book is thoroughly researched and spans the rise & fall of 3 prominent dynasties of the region that shaped the landscape & the culture - the _Chalukyas_, the _Rashtrakutas_ & the formidable _Cholas_.
