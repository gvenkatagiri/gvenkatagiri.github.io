      <description>We live in a time where political leaders ubiquitously rely on region, caste, language, religion, nepotism &amp;amp; other shortcuts to forge a connect with their electorate. George Fernandes, a Tuluva English-speaking Christian born in Mangalore, armed with none of the said shortcuts, led some of the biggest &amp;amp; successful trade union strikes of independent India among a potpourri of industry workers from regions &amp;amp; languages across the country seeking a better life in Bombay.</description>

      <description>While walking along the beaches of Pondicherry in Septmeber 2021, I was inspired while in conversation with Archita (a usual happenstance in my case &amp;amp; a testament to the gem of a person that my wife is) to mindfully make time for reading books. Since then I have managed to channel that inspiration on a regular basis and have been reading consistently. The joys of reading a book are continually reinforced for me with every new book that I read - it is perhaps the best way to expand one&amp;rsquo;s mind, accrue empathy &amp;amp; slowly add wisdom, one layer at a time.</description>
